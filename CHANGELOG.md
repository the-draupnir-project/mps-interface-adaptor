## [0.5.0] - 2025-09-25

### Changed

- Updated MPS for new pagination API.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-06-03

### Fixed

- Listeners for `ge.applied-langua.ge.draupnir.reaction_handler` were not being
  given the annotated event. And instead were being provided with a result
  object.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-06-03

### Changed

- Previously we tried to install the matrix-protection-suite under it's scope
  `@gnuxie/matrix-protection-suite`. Unfortunatley, as far as we can tell, in
  Draupnir this peer dependency would not be satisfied unless we installed a
  duplicate package. Which we're just not going to do. So unfortunatley we will
  have to keep the name consistent with the other packages.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-03

### Changed

- Forgot to add the `prepare` script smh.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-03

### Changed

- Included package information.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-03

- Initial release.
